Setup & Usage

No installation required! You can open and run the notebooks directly in Google Colab.
Steps to open a notebook:
Go to the notebook file in the repository.
Click Open in Colab (or open the notebook in Colab manually).
Run the cells step by step to see data processing, model training, and predictions.

My Role
Developed machine learning models for prediction and classification in Colab.
Preprocessed datasets and performed exploratory data analysis.
Evaluated model performance and visualized results.
Prepared documentation and presentation of project outcomes.
How to Use
Open any project notebook in Google Colab.
Load the dataset provided in the repository.
Run the notebook cells sequentially to see results and visualizations.
